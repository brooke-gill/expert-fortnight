<span>The&nbsp;<strong>King's Quest</strong> is a mission given by the King on the Castle Map. Upon its completion, the King will reward the player with 30% of their prestige's XP requirement, several thousand gold, and a Golden Helmet. The quest is available starting at prestige <span class="m9">I</span>.</span>
<br><span>After talking to the King, in order to complete the King's Quest, three tasks must be completed:</span>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
<li>A <strong>Mini Cake</strong> must be in the player's inventory;</li>
  <li>Kill 100 players;</li>
<li>Collect 10 Renown from major events.</li>
<ul>
  <li>To obtain Yummy Bread, a player needs to right click any furnace in the Kings map with 64 wheat. These furnaces can be found in the barn located at (55, 77, -85).</li>
  <li>The player will then need to go to the Forest quadrant of the map. Upon reaching the shooting range located at (-94, 80, -31), the player will need to stand on the red clay and shoot a target in front of them. This will cause a chicken to fly out; feeding one Yummy Bread to it will cause it to lay an egg.</li><br>

</ul>
<li>Twelve&nbsp;<strong>Sugar Extract</strong>, obtained by mining melon blocks with an axe;</li>
<ul>The axe is obtained from the Barbarian Renown upgrade. It costs 10 <span class="me">Renown</span> and requires prestige <span class="m9">II</span>. The melons are located on the ship in the Port quadrant; they can be found at (-16, 67, 100).</ul><br>
<li>Two&nbsp;<strong>Milk Buckets</strong>, found in chests in the Sewers;</li>
<ul>The sewers can be found beneath the City quadrant. In the sewers, chests frequently spawn, infrequently containing milk.</ul><br>
<li>One&nbsp;<strong>Cherry</strong>, a rare drop from killing players.</li>
</ul>
<span>If the player is unable to complete one or more of these items themselves, they may trade with other players to obtain them.</span><br>
<span>After all of these items are collected, the player will need to talk to the Baker, an NPC that spawns in a random position of the map. Upon giving the baker these ingredients, they will be given one Mini Cake.</span>
<br><br>
<span class="section">Trivia</span><br>
<span>Baking a cake will award the player with the "Baker" achievement, worth 10 Achievement Points.</span><br>
<span>Mini Cakes were added in <a href="https://hypixel.net/threads/the-pit-0-4-1-castle-map-dark-pants.2058146/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Pit 0.4.1</a>, along with the Castle Map and Dark Pants.</span>
